  - Find better image
  - Hover/opacity change on image
  - Improve menu (click on image shows nice button doesn't need to be fancy)
  - Title of interactable object on top of menu OR hover with name
    - "Use" button below
    - Close button or X to hide at bottom
    - If extra time: build logic for what happens when click "Use" including points system/score (in corner?)
